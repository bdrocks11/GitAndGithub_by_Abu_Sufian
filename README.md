the git commands are :


echo "# GitAndGithub_by_Abu_Sufian" >> README.md
git init  ---> initialize the folder for the repository
git add README.md ----> add the files to the repo, as instructed, can add all or name files you want to add
git commit -m "first commit" ----> you are making a commit to upload them to the repository
git branch -M main ----> you are naming your branch
git remote add origin https://github.com/bdrocks11/GitAndGithub_by_Abu_Sufian.git  ---->
above command will add the github remote origin
git push -u origin main ----. this will complete uploading to the remote location.

 i have used all the above commands. 

there are other commands:

git branch, git checkout, git clean, git clone, git config ---> from this list i have used some of the commands as well.
